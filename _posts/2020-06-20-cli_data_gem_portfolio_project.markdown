This is the first project that I did all by myself...not really...because coding is always open-book, I felt like all the people and their generously putting out their knowledge for everyone to read and watch, have helped me so much that I cannot say I did it all by myself.

My first CLI Data Scraping project is about Zodiac Signs. I always go to Horoscope.com when I feel like I need some luck, and want some encouragement or insight on when my days are going to be better, so I imagined someone else might be doing the same too. That's my user story.

The data scraping part was challenging and fun! I am pretty familiar with HTML tags, but objects and the nested structure of the nokogiri is really hard to read if I didn't know how to go one layer down at a time. But I found a pretty good video on YouTube that showed me how to do just that, especially with the href attribute. Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3CLEUBdWwQ

After finishing this project, I'm getting more confident at scrapping. :)

I have some concerns about user input, and the loops that the input needs to go thru...it is working as I wanted it, but the code seems clumsy...I'm hoping to talk to the reviewer for suggestions.

I'm happy that I was able to get the code to do what I wanted it to do, and am also starting to pay more attention to CLI layout design...Good presentation is always appreciated. Right? Users love to look at a nice clean interface. :)
