There are a lot in common between coding and my life. I'm enjoying learning how to code, and enjoying solving coding problems. I like solving small problems in my daily life too.

Humans do not like to wait, we like fast internet. We like files that run fast, and we programmers like to achieve our tasks with minimal lines of code. I'm not a Ruby expect, but I kind of sense that we want to write abstract because it allows us to write less, and do more, which in term translates to efficiency. 

Whenever I find myself doing something repeatedly in daily life, I try to find a way to make it more efficient, like washing dishes. If we wash dishes one at a time, getting soap on the sponge, scrub the dish, then turn on the faucet and rinse the dish, lastly turn off the faucet, and then wash another one with all the same steps, it would take us a lot longer than if we squeeze the soap out only once, and scrub all the dishes one after one, then turn on the faucet and rinse all the dishes together, lastly turn off the faucet after all is done. Coding is like that, we separate our codes into different methods, each method has only one responsibility. We do not repeat ourselves, because no one likes to repeat himself/herself.

I think coding reflects a lot of human nature and the philosophy that we live by.
