Seriously, I cannot write technical blogs yet...even at my last blog post here at Flatiron school. Anything technical that can help others can be found elsewhere, I can only share what I've learned from my last project with React at the bootcamp.

What I've learned:
While I'm doing a bootcamp, it's a self-paced one, and thanks to my 5-year-old son, I extended my study 2 x 3 months. :)
Glad that I really paid for it with real money, otherwise, I'd have abandoned it long ago, just like it happened many times before. And here I am, finishing up my last blog post. Hoping no one is going to read it. LOL

So, I was rushing to finish the course, hoping not to spend extra money to extend the course, but it turned out rushing through a course with access to solutions didn't help when you actually have to build something on your own for the final project. So, for the last project, I was literally learning while doing (building the app).

React is really different from other languages that I've learned, like: js and Ruby. And with JSX together with js for front end and Ruby as backend, things can get really confusing. And I forgot how to write Ruby, because it felt so long ago...glad that most things are open source, and I can still aford to pay for the internet.

Anyways, the more time we spend doing something, the better we get. I got familiar with JSX. Learned that mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps are basically making an object up and put them in the props, and {connect} to the React component, so that the component can use them.

This concludes my final blog post. Thank you.
